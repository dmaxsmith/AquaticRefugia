# AquaticRefugia
We considered a range of climate, topography lithology, and vegetation metrics for their potential to identify areas of potential stability or refugia for aquatic organisms under climate change. Climate data were used to identify macrorefugia, or areas that are expected to undergo less change in temperature, precipitation, or derived variables. Topography, lithology, soil, and vegetation variables were used to identify areas that are likely to have stable water volume and stream temperature (hydrorefugia). The composite index created from these data represents the collective refugia potential of variables found important for aquatic species in New Mexico.
This repository contains example code for calculating composite scores for hydrorefugia and macrorefugia specific to aquatic habitat groups. Also included are maps with final composite score values for refugia indicators (climate, topography, lithology soil, and vegetation variables).
